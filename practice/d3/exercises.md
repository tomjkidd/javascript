The main idea here is to slowly work through progressively more complex behaviors with d3 to get a better understanding of how to use selections to do amazing things.

1. Create an svg element with a single positioned circle.
    
2. Create an svg element with three positioned circles.
    Create three concentric circles.

3. Create an svg element with one circle that has a click transition.
    Create a circle, and add a click transition so that it moves through
    the defined view port.

4. Create an svg element with three circles and three controls.
    *Create three concentric circles as the starting point. The first control will return the circles to this state.
    *The second control should spread the circles out from left to right, with the bottom circle as the leftmost circle.
    *The third control should spread the circles out from top to bottom, with the bottom circle as the topmost circle.

Create an axis
Create a linear scale
Create a simple plot of the function y = x ^ 2 from x = -4 to 4.
Create a plot of two functions, y = x and y = x ^ 2
Create a transition of the y = x ^ 2 plot that slowly plots each point so that its path can be watched as a time series animation.
