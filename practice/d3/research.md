---------
[Mike Bostock][m-bostock] is the author of d3, which he developed as a
PhD student at Stanford. He works for The New York Times, and has tons
of worked out samples showcasing d3 as [blocks][m-bostock-block].

[Jeff Herr][j-herr-home] is a professor that teaches [Data Visualization][j-herr-dv] 
at the University of Washington. His class page has a lot of valuable 
links and information for learning more.

d3 Practice
-----------
A fusion of web standards knowledge (SVG, css, DOM) can be brought to
bear using d3. 

The [Margin Convention][m-bostock-margin] can be used to keep svg work clean.

The [Line Transition][m-bostock-ln-trans] gist was also useful for a starting point for
a simple line chart.

SVG tutorial
------------
The [MDN Tutorial][mdn-tut] is a good place to start, giving an overview
of the necessary tags to get started.

SVG Element Reference

The [MDN Element Reference][mdn-elm] should help with usage of any of the tags.

Jenkov.com tutorial was pretty concise for the 'g' element
