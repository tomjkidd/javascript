What is this ?
--------------
I created a [Spanning Tree simulation using Babel](https://github.com/tomjkidd/javascript/tree/master/practice/babel/computer-networks)
a little while ago and then ran into jspm when trying to figure out which type
es5 deployment pattern to use.


It turns out that just using jspm from the start leads to a much more pleasant
development experiment, so this project demonstrates how to create the
simulation with jspm instead.
