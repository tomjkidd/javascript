This is a proof of concept
--------------------------


I've been working with angular at work, and have followed [John Papa's](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)
lead with respect to creating Controller, Services, and the other artifacts of
angular.


I wanted to prove to myself that these components could be more or less migrated
from their current es5 implementations to their es6 ones without too much hassle.

TestCtrl and TestService represent the type of constructors that I've been
 using, and they are demonstrated in main.js.
