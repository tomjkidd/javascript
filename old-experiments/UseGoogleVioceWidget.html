			For my new smartphone's number, this is the widget value that I got. 
			Looks like we will need to set up a Google Voice account with Josh.
			Josh can then give us his number and we can embed this where it needs to go.
			
			How it works:
			When you click on the icon, it gives Name and Number fields.
			These are the fields for the current user.
			Hitting connect then connects the user to the google voice voicemail box and leaves a message.
			The message can be listened to, and transcribed at the liesure of the voicemail box owner.
